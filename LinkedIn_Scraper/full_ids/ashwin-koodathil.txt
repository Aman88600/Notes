Experience				Experience	"At MathCo, I worked on building data-driven solutions for retail demand forecasting, space optimization, and product substitutability analysis using machine learning, optimization, and deep learning techniques.
 • Demand Forecasting: Developed and deployed forecasting models for a major retail chain using PySpark, Databricks, LightGBM, XGBoost, Prophet, and Neural Prophet. Optimized model performance through Optuna-based hyperparameter tuning, enhancing accuracy and efficiency.
 • Space Optimization: Designed linear and mixed-integer programming (LP, MILP) models using PuLP, PyStan, and PySpark to optimize in-store space allocation and improve product placement strategies.
 • Product Substitutability Analysis: Built embeddings for substitutable products using TensorFlow, Gensim Word2Vec, and Prod2Vec, leveraging hierarchical clustering and the Louvain method for better product grouping and recommendations.
