			Volunteering	Jan 2012 - May 2014 · 2 yrs 5 mos	Tutored Maths to Grade 11's	Tutored Maths to Grade 11's	Tutor maths grade 8's	Cosmo City Secondary	Jan 2012 - May 2014 · 2 yrs 5 mos	Education	Tutor maths grade 8's	Blue Eagle secondary school in Cosmo city	Education		A few years ago I searched for a way to add value to society - I think many of us feel this way at some point so I add this experience in case you are feeling like I was. I chanced upon a guy looking for volunteers for tutoring maths and science which led me to cosmo secondary. I had the privilege of tutoring grade 11's there. The programme however ended due to lack of feedback from the school to FNB who organized the project. Luckily RMB has Thought School so that I could get involved again. It is, for me, a very fulfilling way to spend a Saturday morning. If you are nearby the area and interested let me know. The more people involved the better the experience and learnings for the kids. It is tutoring grade 8 and 9's and is concentrated on Maths but they have fun activities like debates between the classes to help enhance the students English. Very inspiring as well if you just want to stop by and get some ideas for initiatives you are involved in.
