			About	"Hi, I'm Hithesh KK

I am a Data Scientist (Level 2) at Kantar with 3 years of full time industry experience and 6.5 years of hands-on expertise in core Data Science and Machine Learning tools.

I studied Mathematics and Data Science at some of the top institutes in the country, where I developed a strong foundation in first-principles thinking and mathematical rigor. 
In every project I work on, I focus on breaking down problems to their core and finding clear, practical solutions. This approach helps my team navigate complex challenges and I’m always picking up new skills along the way to contribute effectively, no matter the domain.

I worked extensively in Optimization, Feature Pipelines, Predictive Model Pipelines, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Agentic AI from R&D exploration to deployment addressing client needs like budgeting for brand and sales growth, automated quality testing for ads and product concepts and helped drive internal efficiencies within Kantar Qualitative research practice and Kantar Marketplace.

--------------- Background and Motivation ------------
Ever since I was very young, I found math, problem solving and logic very interesting starting from realising I learnt the multiplication table of 6 faster than the other numbers because I used to convert overs to balls and vice versa while watching cricket. As a result, Mathematics and Computer Science were very enjoyable subjects throughout school years. 

While pursuing undergraduate math degree at Indian Statistical Institute in 2018, I grew fond of Probability and Statistics. Very soon, a mentor recommended me the course 'Machine Learning' by Andrew NG and that was how I fell in love with this amazing field. Later, I completed a 100 days of Machine Learning challenge. In the process and in the days after, I learnt a lot of concepts on a variety of topics, did hands-on projects and participated in few data hackathons.

I pursued a MSc. in Data Science at Chennai Mathematical Institute and learnt a lot of relevant concepts with a good balance of mathematical rigor and practical application. I also got the opportunity to spend a combined 6 months gaining industry experience with internships at Kinaxis and Synergy Marine Group (Data Engineering, Feature Pipeline and Graph Visualizations)

I currently work as a Data Scientist at Kantar with great hands-on teams and leadership, and is involved in work related to Optimization, Feature Pipelines, Predictive Model Pipelines, Retrieval Augmented Generation, Agentic AI.
