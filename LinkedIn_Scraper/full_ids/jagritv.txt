					Recommendations	"I first met Aarthi approximately 2.5 years ago when I facilitated a Design Thinking bootcamp at our Chennai office. She introduced herself as a machine learning expert and immediately stood out as someone eager to challenge herself and others. Aarthi naturally excelled, using her innate curiosity and people skills to conduct insightful user research and articulate meaningful findings for solution brainstorming. Her artistic talents also became evident as she happily sketched storyboards of future experiences.

About a year later, I was fortunate to have her on my cross-functional 'task force' to define how we might empower colleagues with GenAI. I was thoroughly impressed with her growth since our time in Chennai. Aarthi possesses a remarkable ability to maintain a broad perspective, adding value across the desirability, feasibility, and viability model – far beyond what's typical for early-career IT professionals. She was an invaluable collaborative partner on this project, consistently adding value and daring to challenge my own perspectives. She contributed strategically and also provided concrete tech recommendations to bring our ideas to life.

Even though that design sprint was some time ago, I’ve continued to observe Aarthi’s growth from the sidelines.

Goutham Kumar	Asia Hub Director	April 21, 2025, Goutham worked with Aarthi on the same team	In my experience working with Aarthi, qualities that make her an asset were evident. Her exceptional contribution to Logitech 's Social Impact project, where she collaborated with us at Team4Tech to support Learning Links Foundation, an education focused NGO.
