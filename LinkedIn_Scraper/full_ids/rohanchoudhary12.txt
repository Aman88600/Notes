						Experience	"● Led a sleep audio segmentation project, leveraging MLFlow for pipeline management for experiment tracking and feature bank creation after engineering audio features. Developed a deep learning model using CNN, LSTM, and TimeDistributed layers to enable end-to-end lifecycle management.
● Filed an A1-grade patent as the Main Inventor in Wearable Sensor Accuracy Improvement using novel ML modules.
● Developed a high-performance AWS backend integrating with the Government of India and Samsung Cloud VPC. Implemented AWS Lambda functions for optimized database management and API operations, achieving scalable, cost-effective execution of large-scale data tasks.
● Fine-tuned and quantized the Mixtral 8x7B LLM model over a dataset of research papers using TensorRT on CUDA-based bare-metal GPUs. Designed advanced prompts and LLM function calling to enhance user journeys in retrieving relevant papers. Utilized LangChain for efficient dataset generation for fine-tuning.
● Built an AWS Glue data catalog (on AWS EMR using Hadoop HDFS and MapReduce) and an ETL pipeline to streamline research papers processing from AWS S3 data lake to Redshift and Quicksight. Combined with Athena, this enabled efficient querying, empowering stakeholders with real-time insights. Automated the pipeline using AWS MWAA with DAG triggers based on S3 size thresholds.
● Developed a sensor-based activity detection system, utilizing smartwatch and ring data. Implemented a Kafka-Databricks pipeline with AWS S3 (parquet storage) for real-time ingestion, transforming signals into actionable features via Fourier transforms."
