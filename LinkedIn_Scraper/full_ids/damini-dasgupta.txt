She have consistently collaborated effectively with colleagues from different teams, making her a valuable contributor to cross-functional projects. Her communication skills, both written and verbal, have been crucial in translating complex technical concepts into understandable insights for non-technical stakeholders. I'm sure Damini will continue to excel in her career as she possesses a rare combination of technical expertise, analytical prowess, and interpersonal skills that makes her a valuable asset to any organization				Kristian Garciamendez-Rowold					Senior Vice President & Lead Data Scientist at Bank of America		September 9, 2023, Kristian managed Damini directly		I had the pleasure of working with Damini for over a year. She joined the modeling team and applied several skills to tackle daily problems and larger projects. Also, she had an open mind and quickly learned on the job. She was always finding ways to optimize her modeling problems and was very thorough in her analysis. A couple of her top qualities are her persistence and hard work. She was always willing to go above and beyond in order to complete projects. She is a true team player and I would recommend her for any role.
