> Matchmaking and Fulfilment - 

1. Reliability Score for request fulfillment 
End-to-end solution to optimize time slot allocation, improving customer satisfaction and reducing unresponded requests by predicting the probability of acceptance of a given time slot shown to customers. ~3% Weighted Absolute Error across 30+ categories reducing Platform-level unresponded requests by 50%. 

2. Peak Orchestrator
Improved the accuracy of peak predictor by revamping the features and using a more complex model to predict the probability of high demand/supply imbalance across hubs for multiple categories. Resulted in 2.6x precision and 2x improvement in recall over the existing legacy model providing more coverage. 

> Facial Analytics Framework 
Set up an end-to-end facial analytics pipeline in UC to identify and verify job starters at Urban Company accurately. The model outperformed Microsoft Azure's solution with 98%+ precision. Further extended the system to enable reverse face lookup with 95%+ accuracy. 

> LLM based solutions

1. SQL query-to-text workflow - Extracted metrics, KPIs, use cases, etc from SQL queries to optimize Snowflake costs and centralize query insights.
2. Customer Review tagging - Conducted sentiment analysis on customer comments, generating actionable insights for provider and SKU optimization.
3. Customer Provider pre-job chat Analysis - Analyzed pre-job customer-provider chats to identify key indicators of potential cancellations or reschedules. Proactively intervened to mitigate these risks.

> Image-Based Models

1. Presentation Attack - Model to detect attempt at presentation image attack during selfie check with 95% recall, 80% precision. 
2. Uniform Adherence - Model to detect if a provider is wearing UC uniform in a selfie uploaded for verification with 90% precision, and 85% recall. 
3. COVID face mask - Model to detect if the provider is wearing a face mask at the customerâ€™s place with 90+% precision 
4. Safety Harness - Model to detect if the AC technician is carrying the mandated safety harness via an uploaded image with 95% precision
