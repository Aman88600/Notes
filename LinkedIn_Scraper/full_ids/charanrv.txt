	About							About	"I am Charan, B.Tech Electronics and Communication Engineering graduate from Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai. Currently, working as a Data Scientist at Google in Bangalore.

I am skilled in Data Science and Machine Learning and proficient with tech stacks like Python, RStudio, Looker Studio, SQL, A/B Testing, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau. I am eager to explore untouched areas in the field of Data Science.

Achieving my dream of joining a FAANG company has been a challenging journey. Despite facing multiple rejections from several major MNCs, I persisted and eventually secured a position at my dream company, Google. I would like to grow professionally and build a strong portfolio by effectively using this opportunity."

Connections,
I had the privilege of being a guest speaker at the Anna Administrative Staff College Trainee Program on the theme ""Artificial Intelligence for Social Good"" from May 24th to May 26th, 2023. On May 25th, I had the honor of delivering an invited talk on the topic of ""Data Visualization"" at Anna Administrative Staff College in Chennai, addressing government officials. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to Miss Sulochana V, the Director of Anna Administrative College, for the opportunity to contribute to this program. It was an enriching experience to share insights on the significance of data visualization in a simple and accessible manner.

Initially, after preprocessing and structuring the data, different statistical analyses were conducted to gather information and infer the obtained results. These results assist in critical decision-making areas such as stock production, marketing, and sales within the organization. They will contribute effectively to the company's growth. Additionally, we have mentioned the products of prominent companies that failed due to a lack of proper statistical analysis, highlighting the importance of such analysis. The information from the data is presented in the form of graphs, charts, and figures, making it easily understandable and interpretable.				Research Paper																				In the real world, data is generated in various ways, including call logs, phone history, screen time, check-in time, check-out time, and more. We can obtain a proper dataset of this content from websites like Kaggle and Google Datasets, enabling us to analyze it in a conventional manner. However, for a change, we have decided to collect this dataset ourselves directly from our smart devices. By doing so, we will be able to visualize our activity trends based on the collected data. Platforms such as RStudio, Tableau, and Power BI can be used for visualization purposes. Through these visualizations, we can draw inferences and gain insights from the data.

Initially, after preprocessing and structuring the data, different statistical analyses were conducted to gather information and infer the obtained results. These results assist in critical decision-making areas such as stock production, marketing, and sales within the organization. They will contribute effectively to the company's growth. Additionally, we have mentioned the products of prominent companies that failed due to a lack of proper statistical analysis, highlighting the importance of such analysis. The information from the data is presented in the form of graphs, charts, and figures, making it easily understandable and interpretable.	https://www.linkedin.com/in/charanrv/overlay/urn:li:fsd_profileProject:(ACoAACmu4hkB1Fb6yGCvHYcQhQbZr2X4uF0SwqE,471469001)/skill-associations-details?profileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAACmu4hkB1Fb6yGCvHYcQhQbZr2X4uF0SwqE		Dec 2022 - Apr 2023	Jul 2022 - Nov 2022	Infographic Analysis of Healthcare with Real Time Data		Associated with Vellore Institute of Technology						Real Time Data Analysis, Data Visualization and +2 skills	https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D562DAQGQfw9tVw62TQ/profile-treasury-document-cover-images_480/profile-treasury-document-cover-images_480/0/1686980963732?e=1757268000&v=beta&t=ZsuRIXKgPHbteWr1Q9J6D0gkYk6pkKHJgDCciDAPM7o		Data Analytics, Real Time Data Analysis and +1 skill	https://www.linkedin.com/in/charanrv/overlay/1635529948865/single-media-viewer?type=DOCUMENT&profileId=ACoAACmu4hkB1Fb6yGCvHYcQhQbZr2X4uF0SwqE	https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D562DAQGFGdO0fBXyjw/profile-treasury-document-cover-images_480/profile-treasury-document-cover-images_480/0/1686981334027?e=1757268000&v=beta&t=GLNpsKqjzuo1GCzyntp0p6iDp4-tJUDCpeHQx4U6Lf0	In the real world, data is generated in various ways, including call logs, phone history, screen time, check-in time, check-out time, and more.
