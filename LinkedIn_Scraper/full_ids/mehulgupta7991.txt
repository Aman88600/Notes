			About	"During my MSci in a Maths and Computer Science degree at University of Birmingham, I completed a Year in Industry at the Mini Plant in Oxford, working as a Data Scientist in the SmartOps team, completed projects for BMW Group sites worldwide. There I brought the Machine Learning and Data Analysis techniques had learnt at University to a team starting out in the field, and helped develop our first Machine Learning use cases, in the field of predictive monitoring. 

I returned to the team on the Graduate Scheme after completing my degree, continuing where I left off. Also on the Graduate Scheme I completed placements at other teams within the company to build my experience, including 6 months at the BMW IT headquarters in Munich

Now I have completed the Graduate Scheme and am a full time employee in the SmartOps Oxford team. I am enjoying improving my current technical skills, while developing new ones working alongside more experienced colleagues. Besides the technical side, I am also benefitting from the experience of project management, where I work with our suppliers to ensure they deliver what is required by our stakeholders, and I am also required to regularly present to our business stakeholders."
