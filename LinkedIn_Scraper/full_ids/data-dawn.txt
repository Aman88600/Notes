					About	"I see each day as a fresh opportunity to learn, unlearn, and refine my understanding of the world—especially through the lens of data. With a strong intuition for numbers and patterns, I enjoy transforming raw data into meaningful insights and building systems that are both innovative and impactful. I’m particularly drawn to the mathematical depths of Machine Learning, constantly pushing myself to explore its nuances and applications.

At New Relic, I work with the Product Data Science team, where I focus on strategy, operations, and team efficiency. I lead the architecture and implementation of scalable systems powered by Classical ML, LLMs, Agentic AI, helping CXOs understand and act on customer retention signals, and integrating data-driven intelligence into core operational workflows.

Previously at Gabit, I worked at the intersection of Fitness, Nutrition, and Skincare, where I led the development of an AI-powered real-time personal trainer. Using just a phone’s front camera, it could detect exercises and count reps—bringing intelligent fitness coaching to everyone’s pocket.

Before that, at Dunzo, I contributed to several key ML projects: from product deduplication and ETA optimization to overhauling recommendation algorithms for Search and Checkout. These efforts significantly enhanced user experience and operational performance."
