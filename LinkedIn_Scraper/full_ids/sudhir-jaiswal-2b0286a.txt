The first thing that comes to my mind is professional, cool-tempered, amazingly logical and reasoning capabilities and of-course a techie-from-head-to-toe. I have had learned many a lessons both technical and non-technical from him and am learning still. We have had many technical debates and I have learned a great deal from it and have most often avoided some blunders. During the start of my career, I used to bench-mark myself with this guy. He has got a very helping nature and I pride myself in having him as my friend.										Received	Given
