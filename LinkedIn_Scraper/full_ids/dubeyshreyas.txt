					About	"I am a data scientist with a passion for storytelling. During the day, I am usually programming, working to derive insight from large datasets. 

My skills include:

 - Python 

 - SQL

 - Data visualization 

 - BI Tools (Tableau & PowerBI)

 - Python Libraries (Seaborn & Matplotlib)

 - Alteryx

 - Exploratory Data Analysis

 - Hypothesis Testing

 - Machine learning

I have developed a strong acumen for problem-solving. I often work on end-to-end data science projects that usually begin by collecting data from third-party sources and end with delivering business insight in the form of customer segments.

Sometimes, I create personal projects and I also enjoy going on sites like HackerRank, Datalameur, and Leetcode to try out their programming challenges.

You can take a look at some of my projects in this Portfolio. I will link my work to their GitHub repositories, so feel free to download my code and play around with it. 

In order to verify my skillset, I've taken a couple of certification exams and as of now I'm certified in the following areas:

1. Hackerrank SQL Advanced Certification

2. Alteryx Core Certified

Apart from the certification, I've also completed many online courses:

Stanford Online - SQL

Stanford Online - Statistics

University of Michigan(Coursera) - Python

Udemy - Tableau

Google Data Analytics (Coursera)

I have downloaded e-books, audited courses on edX and Coursera, and spent countless hours on sites like HackerRank and FreeCodeCamp. I am grateful to online educators who have given me the opportunity to learn these things, and for democratizing education. Working with data is not just a part of my professional curriculum but, it's my passion too that not only helps me achieve more but, makes me inspire others to achieve more.
