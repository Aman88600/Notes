				Projects	"Project -
The customer data from June 2014 - September 2014 for the prepaid customers in the Asian Market of a Telecom operator is given. A customer is said to have churned when he leaves the network. Getting a new customer on-board the network is far more cumbersome than retaining an existing one. Therefore the Telecom operator wants us to analyse the data from June - August and predict the likelihood of the customer churning in September.
The data from June and July is considered to be ""good phase"" data, while the one from August is considered to be in ""action phase"". It is believed that the variation in customer behavior from good phase to action phase drives the cause for a customer to churn.
The business objective is to predict the churn in the last (i.e. the ninth) month using the data (features) from the first three months, and this needs to be done for the High-Value customers"	telecom churn case study			Feb 2020 - Mar 2020	Lead scoring case study	Oct 2019 - Dec 2019							telecom churn case study	Feb 2020 - Mar 2020	Oct 2019 - Dec 2019	https://www.linkedin.com/in/datascientist-tushar/overlay/urn:li:fsd_profileProject:(ACoAAAvjTuoBnwSPvv6fCjVRrWIoArWqEgQyEcE,526612613)/skill-associations-details?profileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAvjTuoBnwSPvv6fCjVRrWIoArWqEgQyEcE	Machine Learning				Lead scoring case study			"Project - The customer data from June 2014 - September 2014 for the prepaid customers in the Asian Market of a Telecom operator is given.

The conversion rate in the input dataset is 30% and the ballpark of the target lead conversion rate needs to be around 80%. The CEO will have the team focus on the leads that the model results as promising to make the “lead to customer” process more efficient. Therefore, the Business objective is to select the most promising leads – the ones that are highly likely to convert into paying customers.	https://www.kaggle.com/tgupta3/lead-scoring-case-study	Show all 5 projects	Show project
