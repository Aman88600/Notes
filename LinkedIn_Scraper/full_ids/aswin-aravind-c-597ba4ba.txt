Welcome to Day 5 of our enlightening journey towards mastering data science interviews! üéâ Today's spotlight is on two essential statistical concepts: Probability Density Function (PDF) and Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF). These foundational elements are critical for analyzing data distributions and are extensively used in both theoretical and applied data science.

üîç Unveiling PDF and CDF:
We'll delve into understanding the distinction between PDF and CDF and their pivotal role in statistical analysis. Our discussion will cover how to leverage PDF for interpreting data variances and the methodology behind calculating CDF from PDF, enhancing our ability to make informed decisions in data preprocessing and model evaluation.

ü§ù Let‚Äôs Connect & Discuss:
Your insights on applying PDF and CDF in real-world data scenarios could greatly benefit our community. Whether it's challenges you've faced in interpretation, unique applications, or questions about these functions, let's share and learn together below!
