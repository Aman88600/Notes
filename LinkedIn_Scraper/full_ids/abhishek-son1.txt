I'm often approached by fellow LinkedIn members for guidance on their journey toward a data scientist role, requests for referrals, or an interest in my own path to becoming a data scientist. 
When I review resumes, I often find areas that need improvement and it is challenging to address all requests.

To assist, starting tomorrow I'll be posting a series that covers the entire spectrum from how or what to learn in the foundations of data science to its practical applications and interview preparation.
I'll be sharing the journey as if I were starting it again.

Feel free to share your suggestions in the comments if there's a particular subject you'd like me to delve into.

Solution: Collected data from the data source using SQL and analyzed discrepancies using Python’s scipy, plotly, matplotlib etc. to provide statistics about discrepancy’s pattern with its resolution code. Business Impact: Insights helped business in decreasing discrepancies by around 7% month on month. Agent’s retention amount prediction Problem: Figure out amount that can be retained from agent’s salary based on his willingness, interest rate, band, experience, current salary and market id etc to increase reserves and decrease chances of agent’s attrition. Solution: Preprocessed highly skewed data with box cox transformation, imputed missing values using combination of different techniques like using maximum frequency, prediction models, correlated features, and generated new features based on feature importance to perform regression. Business Impact: Helped Verizon business in getting more employees going for retention program as model predicted a comfortable amount figure for agents and this all benefitted with 1.43$ million annually.

Solution: A classification model for prediction of device’s replacement was made by handling highly imbalanced data using a combination of under sampling and oversampling with SMOTE and data partitioning. Business Impact: Improved customer experience with help of pop up about replacement 89% of times Commission Calculation system for Agents Problem: Create database architecture for a new compensation type which is shared compensation which calculates shared commission among agents for transactions done by many agents together. Solution: Built a data pipeline in Pl / Sql starting from flat files till the destination tables using sql loaders, cursors etc. and applied partitioning, indexing for better performance along with other complex logics. Business Impact: Enabled business to calculate shared compensation through the compensation portal instead of calculating them manually.
