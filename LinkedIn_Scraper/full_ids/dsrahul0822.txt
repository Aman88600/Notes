üîä Imagine asking questions about your company‚Äôs policy handbook using your voice, and getting instant, intelligent answers ‚Äî all powered by LangChain, OpenAI, and Vosk!
üéØ Here's what I created:
A fully Voice-Enabled RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system
 that understands what I say, retrieves the right context from a PDF,
 and answers me with spoken responses ‚Äî like a real assistant.
üß† Tech Stack:
‚úÖ Vosk for real-time voice transcription
‚úÖ LangChain for RAG pipeline
‚úÖ OpenAI (GPT-4) for answer generation
‚úÖ Pyttsx3 for voice output
‚úÖ Streamlit for the frontend UI

üíº Use Case:
 This prototype is designed around an Employee Policy Assistant ‚Äì
 so anyone can just ask:
 ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the sick leave policy?‚Äù
 ‚ÄúHow many casual leaves do I get?‚Äù
 and instantly get a voice-based answer! üó£Ô∏è


üî• Why this matters:
 ‚Üí Voice is the next interface.
 ‚Üí No more scrolling through PDFs.
 ‚Üí Making GenAI tools more human-friendly.
Let me know what you think! Would love to hear feedback & ideas for other use cases!
