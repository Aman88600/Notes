In todays world, many people are working in the banking sector directly or indirectly. Either for their client or their own esteemed firm. In there day to day life they deal with lot of issues regarding model selection techniques, statistical tests, feature engineering and feature selection techniques. I tried my best to take a step forward for them and help them in this regard. I am sharing a pdf of an article from ScienceDirect (https://lnkd.in/eztGdfr). This is going to solve a lot of issues that they are dealing with in there daily work. 

Even this post is for all the Data Science Enthusiasts who are trying there level best for making there career in Risk Analytics. 

Requirement for proper use of this article:
1. One should be aware about Machine Learning algorithms like Logistic regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees, KNN, Naive Bayes, KNN, Statistics for Business Analytics, Deep Learning models like CNN. 
2. Metrics required in Classification Modelling.
3. Little Domain Knowledge would add benefit.

Additional Effort:
I have underlined important points from the Research Paper and put few comments in order to get more clarity while reading.

I would request all the Data Science Enthusiasts and professionals to kindly go through it and give your suggestions in the comment or incase if you want to have any healthy conversation regarding Risk Analytics, you are most welcomed to DM me as well.
