						Publications	Strategic innovation diffusion converts newly created knowledge into increasing a firm’s value primarily through innovative product offerings. In this paper, we present a time-based adoption pattern with pricing and promotional expenditure as a three-dimensional innovation diffusion model (3D-IDM). In our proposed 3D-IDM, we assume that value of the product plays a crucial role of being the major driver of diffusion, and is classified into the following three main factors: (1) continuation time of the product in the market – representing goodwill of the product; (2) price of the product – indicating consumers’ buying behaviour; and (3) marketing efforts of the firm. A special form of the Cobb–Douglas production function is used to design the three-dimensional framework. An empirical study is performed on number of consumer-durable sales data to validate and compare the proposed model. Various performance measures are treated uniquely using the Mahalanobis distance-based approach (DBA) to determine the relative strength of each model.

International Journal of Reliability, Quality and Safety Engineering (IJRQSE), World Scientific · May 30, 2016	Other authors			or the past several decades, reliability has been presumed as the most important characteristic of any complex software system. Software developer’s assurance of high quality and reliable software is driven on the basis of efficient reliability assessment. Since 1970’s an unprecedented growth has been observed in the area of software reliability growth modeling. Software reliability growth models (SRGM) are linked to the testing stage of software development and provides for insights into ways to improve reliability of the system and optimal time to release the software. Several SRGMs have been proposed in the literature to model fault identification/removal phenomenon based on time; search for more efficient and accurate models that can fit greater number of reliability growth curves is endless. Categorization of faults lying in the software has been widely studied as well. Also, efforts have been made in the past to understand reliability issues concerned with modular software system. In this paper we examine three different types of faults lying in complex software and study their behavior in an N-module software system. In order to attain two fold objectives of maximizing reliability of such a system and minimizing overall debugging cost, we propose two related optimization models. The inbuilt model flexibility takes care of different environment. The model is validated by real life software failure data set to show its goodness of fit and applicability.				https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C5103AQEjEj6HpundWA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/profile-displayphoto-shrink_100_100/0/1531913483170?e=1759363200&v=beta&t=QtgVp5vz6QzFUqUtpfB3pPkkT0DoxEdwhVg1jgK139Q														https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitin-sachdeva-72b2709/overlay/urn:li:fsd_profilePublication:(ACoAAAGj4xMBNtLXd-GWZInIDhP1t_13iRr1ENM,480792172)/authors?profileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAGj4xMBNtLXd-GWZInIDhP1t_13iRr1ENM	http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23270012.2016.1197052	An Innovation Diffusion Model for Consumer Durables with Three Parameters	Journal of Management Analytics, Taylor & Francis · May 31, 2016	International Journal of Reliability, Quality and Safety Engineering (IJRQSE), World Scientific · May 30, 2016	http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/S0218539316400040	https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitin-sachdeva-72b2709/overlay/urn:li:fsd_profilePublication:(ACoAAAGj4xMBNtLXd-GWZInIDhP1t_13iRr1ENM,480923129)/authors?profileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAGj4xMBNtLXd-GWZInIDhP1t_13iRr1ENM		Optimization Problems for a Modular Software With Faults of Different Severity					https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitin-sachdeva-72b2709/details/publications?profileUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_profile%3AACoAAAGj4xMBNtLXd-GWZInIDhP1t_13iRr1ENM	Show all 13 publications	Other authors
