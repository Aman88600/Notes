"I built a Resume Retrieval System using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to let users ask natural language questions about resumes and get accurate, context-aware answers.

The system reads PDF resumes from a folder, splits them into chunks, and converts each chunk into embeddings using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from Hugging Face. These embeddings are stored in a FAISS vector database, enabling fast and meaningful similarity searches.

When a user submits a query, it is also embedded and compared with the stored data using FAISS. The most relevant chunks are retrieved and passed to the llama3-70b-8192 large language model, which generates a response based only on that context.

This project demonstrates how AI can streamline resume screening by combining document processing, semantic search, and LLM-based answering to find the right candidates faster and more accurately."

It is going to be something interesting” whether that meme is going to make us laugh or smile or even nothing. 0ver the past decade, memes has become very popular in many areas such as computer science, marketing, health care, sociology, technology etc. and day by day as people are spending more time over internet, its popularity is increasing, it’s all because it passes information with a pinch of humor even a serious one. Nowadays social media sites such as Reddit, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter are flooded with memes, even government officers and organizations are trying to convey messages to publicly using memes, isn’t that interesting. During all this, some memes becomes viral and there should be a reason for becoming a meme viral, right?.

So, in this project I am going to try to find the reasons behind becoming a meme viral and try to predict whether a meme will become viral or not based on data provided for meme and information available in the meme using Deep Learning and Machine Learning."

Mechanism of Action (MoA) is a label given to a molecule to describe its biological activity after treating it with a drug. In the past, scientists derived drugs from natural products or were inspired by traditional remedies. Today, with the advent of more powerful technologies, drug discovery has changed from the serendipitous approaches of the past to a more targeted model based on an understanding of the underlying biological mechanism of a disease.
