Jan 2020 to Jan 2025 · 5 yrs 1 mo	Tamil Nadu, India	Building new class of Statistical and machine learning models for performance assurance of cloud applications. My role is to solve anything and everything related to ML engine in OpsCruise. Some of my primary tasks are: ✪ Anomaly Detection - Finding application performance problems by detecting unexpected emerging behavioral changes/anomalies in real time using machine learning models. ✪ Scalability - Reducing the application complexity with appropriate ML algorithms and DB selection. Pruning of the models with controled performance. ✪ Optimization - Finding the optimal solutions for the product and business needs with minimal risk. ✪ Semi Supervised Learning - Self learnt label genration, based on user activity with automated reinforcement learning for better and context driven alerts. ✪ Dynamic SLO - Eliminating the need to select metrics or tune thresholds manually. ✪ Extended Visibility - Gaining unprecedented real time visibility into cloud applications, relationship to the Kubernetes infrastructure and all service dependencies. ✪ Automated RCA - Root Cause Analysis to isolate the actual reason behind a cluster of performance issues and to minimize the 'Time to Recover' using graph theory and statistical models. ✪ Model pruning - Developed Model pruning algorithm for unsupervised framework with zero or marginal loss in terms of accuracy . ✪ Research to Production - Experience in converting various research prototypes into production.	https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/C560BAQGNtpblgQpJoQ/company-logo_100_100/company-logo_100_100/0/1662120928214/deloitte_logo?e=1759363200&v=beta&t=38I3bvp0_NVwN8njENYPZSP_5qRy6gTPzEafyisF6rk	Data Scientist	HealthLucid	Mar 2018 to Dec 2019 · 1 yr 10 mos	Bengaluru, Karnataka, India	"Created several Machine Learning models to develop a product to reduce US healthcare expenses. ♠ Gaps In Care - Created “Gaps In Care” feature with potential of reducing two-thirds of the Chronic Disease expenses within US. Used Random Forest Classifier to classify members who are likely to develop or already have developed different chronic conditions and suggested certain preventive tests/routine tests/medical advice to avoid big dollar critical end stage expenses. US Medicare spending on CKD and ESRD in 2018 was $114 billion. Source: https://www.usrds.org/ ♠ Payment Integrity - Implemented density based Clustering algorithms to identify anomalies in an insurance company’s medical claim data in the context of ""Up Coding"" & “Proxy Billing”. ♠ Increasing Adoption - Developed strategies by designing A/B tests to increase the adoption of the app. ♠ Episoding Algorithm - Developed algorithms to identify an entire episode of care for Outpatient or Inpatient services. Predicted incomplete episodes with potential missing claims and estimated the actual complete episode cost."	https://www.linkedin.com/company/759889/	https://www.linkedin.com/company/759889/	Principal Data Scientist & Global Technical Lead of AI-ML, Data Science division	Securonix	https://www.linkedin.com/company/30877963/	https://www.linkedin.com/company/30877963/	Senior Data Scientist	Virtana Corp.
