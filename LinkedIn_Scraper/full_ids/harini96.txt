			About	"I have always been someone who uses data to make decisions in her personal life. So when I discovered Data Science after my Bachelor's in Mathematics, it felt like the most natural thing in the world to me. It felt intuitive and just right for me and thatâ€™s a very rare and exciting feeling! So, I decided to pursue it and here I am still, 3 years later, with that feeling only growing every day.

I am a growth-minded Data Scientist who is passionate about finding and communicating actionable insights through data analysis, machine learning and data visualization. I am currently working at Bijak (an agri-tech company) on a variety of projects.

I also play with datasets on Kaggle during my free time to develop my skills, as well as to explore areas I didn't get a chance to work on during my Master's degree in Data Analytics. You can check them out on my GitHub here:
