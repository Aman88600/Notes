						Experience	"Part of a team which works on machine learning projects with main focus on time series data.
Pursuing the load disaggregation problem to find the exact power consumption made by individual devices in homes. Tried Hidden Markov models (HMMs), now exploring Variational Autoencoders for the same.
Worked on PHM Data Challenge where it is required to estimate the time-to-failure (TTF) for Ion millingmachines. Employed different fault detection methodologies and regression techniques like Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS), LSTMs and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) for TTF estimation.
Created models to estimate the Remaining Useful Life of the tool used in CNC machines and to detect changesin the machine's operation patterns to identify faults. Used Random Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Deep Belief Networks (DBNs) for this solution.
To train DBNs for regression employed Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to generate more data from the scarce data for CNC machine's operations.
Involved in the project to forecast the performance of the Enterprise System Bus. Predictions made day-ahead at 5 min granularity. Used Dynamic factor graphs (DFGs) and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) SVR for this time series prediction problem.
Developed algorithms for prediction of Electrical Load Consumption in commercial buildings day-ahead, week-ahead and month-ahead at 15 min granularity. Used Neural Networks with automatically chosen lagged values of load and contextual variables as input. Also made changes to Dynamic Factor Graphs (DFGs) structure for accurate forecasting of the electrical load.

Research Intern	Artifacia	Apr 2016 to Jun 2016 · 3 mos	At Artifacia, a visual intelligence based start-up, I built a tool called ‘Complete the Look’ that automatically creates collections of fashion items (top-wear, bottom-wear, bags and footwear), which go well together. It was modeled using Bayesian Networks. Another project was to explore ‘one shot’ and ‘zero shot’ learning algorithms, which need very few examples (1~5 images) or no example to train the classifier.	https://www.linkedin.com/company/3788927/	https://www.linkedin.com/company/3788927/	Razorpay	Full-time · 4 yrs 7 mos	https://www.linkedin.com/company/3788927/	Senior Data Scientist	Mar 2023 - Present · 2 yrs 6 mos	https://www.linkedin.com/company/3788927/	Data Scientist	Hybrid	https://www.linkedin.com/company/1321007/	https://www.linkedin.com/company/1321007/	Principal Product Engineer	Cybernetyx	Jan 2019 - Dec 2020 · 2 yrs

MS Thesis - ""Towards an Automated Home Interior Designer System ""
• It is an almost completely automated intelligent system that produces realistic and aesthetically
appealing interior designs for homes.
• Striking feature of our current implementation for living rooms: it generates multiple plausible options￼ for the user to choose from, exactly what one would expect from an interior designer.
• The relationships between different elements of a room and items placed in the room are represented as Bayesian networks.
• These Bayesian networks are learnt from human-architected layouts. New layouts based on user inputs are generated upon inferencing from these learnt networks."

						Projects	Geographic information systems project - It classifies the regions of Bangalore into various land use classes such as water-clear, water-dirty, built-up high intensity, built-up low intensity, green-land, open-land, roads, and others. Used maximum likelihood classification approach for this. This process is then repeated 3 times for landsat images for the year 1993, 2000 and 2013. Then did a change detection study on classification results for each land use class to see how the city has evolved over decades.

Given Heart Disease Database from UCI ML Repository, our goal was to provide an estimate of presence of heart disease in the patient. This estimate is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4. Based on various heath related attributes such as cholesterol, blood sugar levels, age, resting ECG etc. a multilayer feed forward neural network classifies the patient into one of the 5 classes of risk.
