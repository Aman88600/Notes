Featured						Featured	"I left Amazon two years ago, and I still get DMs from recruiters at Meta and OpenAI. Last week, I had the opportunity to share the story with Business Insider.

From starting an internal newsletter at Amazon, to launching a podcast, to helping mid-career data science and ML professionals get seen for the value they already bring.

Fast forward to today, and that quiet visibility still opens doors. Not just for job opportunities but for career possibilities that I never knew existed.

Proud to share this piece!

If it helps even one “quiet expert” realize their voice is their leverage, it’s worth it.

As a new data scientist, I used to feel that senior data scientists knew all the technical details and could finish work alone. After 5 years, I became a senior data scientist, and I realized that's not true. 

It's the non-technical skills that make a data scientist great:

·I know how to figure things out
·I know how to get the right people to help me 
·I know when to announce it’s failed and when it’s good enough to launch

I figured out many things on my own and with great mentors, and I wish everyone in their early/mid-career career can advance with what I learned from 7 years at Amazon.

If you are a data scientist who feels stuck and wants to grow, I launched a ""data science career accelerator"" to help you advance your career. In two weeks, you'll learn:

· Stakeholder management and effective communication
· How to have an impact and get a promotion 
· How to iterate data science&ML projects 
· How to find a career path that leverages your strength
· How to build influence in the industry and have a bullet-proof career
· The new paradigm of data science and ML careers in 2024

Recommendations						Recommendations	"I had the pleasure of working with Daliana at AWS, and what stood out to me then is the same thing that stands out now: she has a rare mix of technical sharpness and grounded clarity. We collaborated on a complex computer vision PoC for a major sports analytics customer. high pressure, tight timelines, many opinions in the room. Daliana always brought focus, energy, and a bias toward action.
Since then, I’ve continued to turn to her for perspective. She’s one of the few people I know who can zoom out without losing precision, whether it’s about navigating a technical career, making the leap into GenAI, or just figuring out what actually matters in your work. She’s spoken to so many leaders in the space, yet she remains humble, curious, and deeply thoughtful.
If you’re looking to learn from someone who not only knows how to grow a career in tech, but also how to do it without losing yourself in the process, Daliana is someone I’d recommend without hesitation."
