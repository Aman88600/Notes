				About	My abilities as a Data Scientist are rooted in my sturdy education in statistics. I began with a bachelor’s degree in Electronics engineering followed this with a master’s degree in Signal processing (probabilistic and statistical analyses). I attribute my success as a Data Scientist in large part to this extensive and in-depth education. I believe my personality has also played a major role in my ability to succeed in this career. I am an extremely analytical, data-oriented, and calculated. Even in my personal life I like to look at the data before making a decision. I like to analyze outcomes.
