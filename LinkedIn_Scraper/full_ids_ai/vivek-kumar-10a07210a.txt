    "about": "I am a data scientist with a passion for storytelling. During the day, I am usually programming, working to derive insight from large datasets. My skills include Python, SQL, Data visualization, BI Tools (Tableau & PowerBI), Python Libraries (Seaborn & Matplotlib), Alteryx, Exploratory Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Machine learning. I have developed a strong acumen for problem-solving. I often work on end-to-end data science projects that usually begin by collecting data from third-party sources and end with delivering business insight in the form of customer segments. Sometimes, I create personal projects and I also enjoy going on sites like HackerRank, Datalameur, and Leetcode to try out their programming challenges. Please go through my Portfolio to take a look at my work."
