    "about": "I build AI systems that make sense. Currently, I’m a Senior Data Scientist at Delta Air Lines, working on Generative AI, NLP, and Causal Inference to solve real-world problems at scale. With a background in Machine Learning, Explainable AI, and C++, I specialize in creating AI models that are not just powerful but also interpretable and actionable. Beyond my role at Delta, I’m also building PivotAI, an initiative focused on AI-driven innovation. Previously, I worked at Deutsche Telekom, where I tackled complex ML challenges, optimizing large-scale AI applications.",
