    "summary": "Balancing the pursuit of dual degrees in Data Science from IIT Madras and Health Science from the University of the People alongside a full-time job since the age of 18 has been both challenging and rewarding. This journey has not only strengthened my ability to manage time effectively under intense pressure but also shaped me into a resilient and adaptable professional. Through my academic endeavors, I have developed a strong foundation in data analysis, statistical modeling, and programming, with a focus on practical applications in fields such as mental health trends and marketing success rates. My professional experience spans over three years in the banking and finance sector, particularly in credit card operations, where I have excelled in both individual and leadership roles. I have successfully managed teams of sales professionals, driving the acquisition and promotion of financial products and consistently achieving and exceeding sales targets. I have devised customer-focused campaigns, provided personalized consultations, and conducted training sessions to enhance team performance and conversion rates. In my previous roles, I guided clients in selecting suitable financial solutions, educated them about credit scores, and surpassed sales targets through tailored interactions. I have also developed strong expertise in telesales, open-market strategies, and dispute resolution, which laid the foundation for my success in customer-centric sales and marketing. Beyond my professional accomplishments, my technical proficiency includes Python, SQL, Jupyter, and Microsoft Office. I have utilized these tools in various academic projects, such as designing predictive machine learning models, analyzing social trends, and creating functional web applications. My ability to merge technical expertise with real-world problem-solving has been a significant asset in delivering impactful solutions. Passionate about continuous self-improvement, I am committed to learning and evolving in every role I undertake. My academic projects, including studies on social media impact and leadership strategies, reflect my dedication to understanding diverse perspectives and applying innovative solutions to complex challenges. Looking ahead, I aim to leverage my unique combination of technical knowledge, leadership experience, and a customer-centric approach to make a meaningful impact in dynamic and challenging environments. \"If something holds you back, burn them with your wings of fire.\""

This journey has been nothing short of transformative, and I owe a huge part of it to the IIT Madras BS in Data Science Programme, which helped me pivot and grow in a field I‚Äôve become truly passionate about. A few years ago, I couldn‚Äôt secure a government seat through NEET‚Äînot because I failed, but because my score didn‚Äôt meet the cutoff. While it was disappointing at the time, it opened the door to new possibilities. Choosing a different path wasn‚Äôt easy, but it turned out to be the path meant for me. Grateful for the guidance, the learning, and everyone who's supported me along the way. Here's to new beginnings, unexpected journeys, and the incredible power of perseverance! üí´",
