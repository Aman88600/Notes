**Notes on mapping the fields:**
- **Basic Info**: Extracted location; no direct name or profile URL in the sample.
- **Activity**: Collected followers and indicated that post data would be here.
- **Experience**: The title and company were somewhat redundant but are included as presented.
- **Education**, **Certification**, **Skills**: No information was present for these fields, so empty arrays are used.
- **Interests**: Total follower count and details on the "Top Voice" interest (Satya Nadella).

The arrangement follows the consensus and best practices in tools and workflows described for LinkedIn-to-JSON conversion[1][2][3][4].
