    "about": "Being a class of 2020 graduates is sure a big challenge. After couple of months projecting myself sending CVs to a couple of companies, walk in into interviews, and start to work enthusiastically, suddenly dropped after seeing a lots of companies layoffs due to the pandemic. And of course, my hope on getting into a job in a short time after I graduated slowly fading away. But that doesn't stops me. After figuring out some alternatives to not wasting my precious time, I decided to spend my whole quarantine by conducting a research with my friends, hoping that we could give an impact especially for the NLP community. (Check it out here! https://lnkd.in/gZVNvdT)\n\nI remember trying so hard on assembly programming, linear algebra, fourier series not knowing what can I do with studying these bunch of difficult subjects. But then suddenly it all clicked when I jumped into Data Scientist career as an intern and began my interest in machine learning. That feeling when you found some insights on the data you assembled and visualize, and how you can build algorithms to solve your mystery through machine learning never fails to enthralling me until today. With all the not-fully-relevant basics, I jump easily to python and I love spending hours on improving my codes.\n\nDuring my internship, I implemented my python skills for data scientist applications such as building a model on a specific purpose, and also did a lot of feature engineering. I continue my journey by working as a Final Year Student Research doing an NLU (NLP) tasks on text classification using Deep Learning approach. I did all my work on Python, with the help of PyTorch and also Tensorflow, and other libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib and a lot more. On my final semester, I assisted on visual programming laboratory by teaching basic computer vision using PIL, OpenCV, CNN on Keras, and etc.\n\nI am well-known as someone who communicates well, a team player, organized, easily adapt, having a good problem solving abilities, and would love to connect with you!"
